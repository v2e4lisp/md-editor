# MD-editor
Inspired by this post: [One line browser notepad](https://coderwall.com/p/lhsrcq)    
And many thanks to this [piece of code](http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=NzbtwjEy)
and [this](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-app-samples/tree/master/text-editor).      
Actually this app is just a combination of the codes above. It's all messd up.  
I'll try to make them decent in the near future or maybe you can help me. :)
